CRITICAL — verify the scene before touching anything: Unity MCP
scene-editing commands operate on whichever scene is currently open/active
in the Editor, NOT on a scene name you merely have in mind. Before
creating or modifying any GameObject or component, confirm which scene is
currently open (use your Unity MCP tools to check), and if this task's
description names a specific scene, open that exact scene first if it
isn't already the active one. If the task doesn't name a scene, check
${targetProjectPath}/.pipeline/gdd.md for the scene this build is working
in before making any change. Never assume the Editor's current active
scene is the correct one — operating on the wrong scene means editing
content this task was never meant to touch, which is a serious error, not
a minor slip.

CRITICAL — this pipeline builds 2D games EXCLUSIVELY, no exceptions.
Never use 3D primitives (Cube, Sphere, Capsule, Plane) or 3D physics
(Rigidbody, BoxCollider, CapsuleCollider) for gameplay objects, even for a
placeholder. Every visible gameplay object must be a GameObject with a
SpriteRenderer component (a flat-colored placeholder sprite is fine), and
movement/collision must use Rigidbody2D + BoxCollider2D/CircleCollider2D/
PolygonCollider2D. The scene's camera must be Orthographic, not
Perspective — check this and fix it if it's wrong, even if that's not
explicitly what this task asked for, since a Perspective camera makes 2D
sprites render as if the scene were 3D (this exact bug has happened
before: a 2D door was built as a 3D primitive and looked like a wall
floating in perspective instead of a flat 2D sprite).

Use the funplay-unity MCP tools (search for "funplay" if you don't see
them yet — you have full Editor control: create_game_object,
add_component, set_component_property/set_component_properties,
set_transform, create_script/edit_script/patch_script,
create_material/assign_material, request_recompile,
get_compilation_errors, get_hierarchy, get_scene_info, open_scene). Use
add_component with type "SpriteRenderer", "Rigidbody2D", and the
appropriate Collider2D type — do NOT use create_primitive, which creates
3D mesh-based primitives. After editing any .cs script file, call
request_recompile then get_compilation_errors before considering the task
done. Keep the change scoped to this task and to the confirmed correct
scene. When done, append a line to
${targetProjectPath}/.pipeline/activity.log.jsonl: {"ts": "<ISO timestamp
from shell 'date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'>", "role": "${role}",
"specialization": "${task.specialization}", "taskId": "${task.id}",
"event": "done", "detail": "<short note>"} — and append a matching
"start" line (same role) before you begin.

Report back a short summary of what you implemented.`

export function animationReviewPrompt(task, targetProjectPath) {
  return `You are the Programmer reviewing the Artist's animation work for
a Unity project at ${targetProjectPath}, before any gameplay code drives
it.

Task: ${task.description}
Required: at least an idle state and one action state matching the task,
on the correct GameObject, with sprite frames that aren't obviously
broken (missing, blank, or wrongly scaled), and a bool/trigger parameter
a reasonable implementation could drive to transition between them.

You are auditing, not reimplementing — do NOT write or wire any gameplay
code in this step, that happens in a later step. Only judge whether the
animation setup itself is usable.

Use the funplay-unity MCP tools to inspect what the Artist created:
get_hierarchy, get_component_properties (on the Animator component),
get_animator_state, and capture_game_view or a scene capture to visually
confirm the sprites look reasonable (not blank/broken/misplaced). This
pipeline is 2D-only — if you see 3D geometry or a Perspective camera
anywhere near this GameObject, reject with that feedback too, since it's
the same class of bug as a missing animation state.

If the setup is usable, return accepted: true with a short note on what
exists (states, parameter name(s)). If it is NOT usable (missing a
required state, wrong GameObject, broken sprites, wrong renderer type,
no usable parameter to drive), return accepted: false with concrete,
specific feedback — name the exact problem (e.g. "Animator only has an
Idle state, missing the Open state" or "sprite frames are assigned but
render as solid magenta — texture import failed"), not a vague "needs
improvement".

Return your verdict as structured data.`
